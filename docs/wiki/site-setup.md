# Site Setup Overview

This guide outlines the process for setting up a site using **Unstoppable Domains**, **GitHub Pages**, and a **custom domain**.

## Step 1: Purchasing the Domain

1. **Unstoppable Domains** is used to purchase a **.crypto** or **.xyz** domain that can be linked to a **GitHub Pages** site.
   - Go to [Unstoppable Domains](https://unstoppabledomains.com) to search for and purchase your custom domain (e.g., **dovahw.xyz**).
   - Complete the purchase process and follow the platformâ€™s instructions to manage your domain.

## Step 2: Setting Up GitHub Pages

For detailed instructions on setting up **GitHub Pages** with a custom domain, please refer to the official [GitHub Pages documentation for custom domains](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site).

## Step 3: Configuring DNS Records

1. In **Unstoppable Domains**, configure **DNS settings** for your custom domain.
   - Refer to the official GitHub Pages documentation for setting the correct **A records** and **CNAME records** for your custom domain.

## Step 4: Set the Custom Domain in GitHub

1. Once DNS records are updated, follow the steps in the [GitHub Pages Custom Domain documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site) to link your custom domain to the repository.

## Step 5: Wait for DNS Propagation

It may take up to **48 hours** for the DNS changes to fully propagate across the internet. Once complete, your site will be accessible via your custom domain.
