# Department of Vibes and Haiku Warfare

# Dev, Ops, and chill ðŸ¥·

Welcome to the most dangerous poetry machine on the internet.

Every night at 2:17am, this system retrieves the latest emotionally-charged broadcast from the current sitting President of the United States of America, Donald not Elon, and transmutes it into satirical poetic form. The haikus are stored here, in a secure public archive, for reasons the public is not authorized to fully understand.

## Warning

Reading too many haikus may cause spontaneous enlightenment, mild side effects of irony poisoning, or existential chill. Proceed with caution.

## Stretch Goals

Become subject of a [retaliatory executive order](https://www.npr.org/2025/03/28/g-s1-56890/law-firms-sue-trump).
