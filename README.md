# Department of Vibes and Haiku Warfare

Welcome to the most dangerous poetry machine on the internet.

Every night at 2:17am, this system retrieves the latest emotionally-charged broadcast from a former head of state and transmutes it into satirical poetic form. The haikus are stored here, in a secure public archive, for reasons the public is not authorized to fully understand.

## Warning

Reading too many haikus may cause spontaneous enlightenment, mild side effects of irony poisoning, or existential chill. Proceed with caution.
